### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Agent Simulator"
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install autogen-agentchat autogen-core autogen-ext
   ```

4. **Configure OpenAI API key**
   ```bash
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Windows
   # or
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Linux/Mac
   ```

5. **Generate orchestrator configuration**
   ```bash
   python create_benefit_orchestrator.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Import to AutoGen Studio**
   - Open AutoGen Studio
   - Import the generated `generated_orchestrator.json` file
   - The complete team configuration will be loaded

2. **Start a conversation**
   - Provide a request ID (e.g., "REQ-001")
   - The system will automatically process the request through the workflow

## üìã Workflow Process

### 1. Request Analysis
- **Input**: Request ID from user
- **Action**: Retrieves request details and routes to customer verification
- **Output**: Complete request information

### 2. Customer Verification
- **Input**: Requestor information
- **Action**: Fuzzy matching against customer database
- **Output**: Verification result with confidence score

### 3. Document Processing
- **Input**: Document requests from other agents
- **Action**: Retrieves and analyzes document content
- **Output**: Document information and analysis

### 4. Eligibility Decision
- **Input**: Customer verification and document data
- **Action**: Applies military benefit eligibility rules
- **Output**: APPROVED/DECLINED decision with justification

### 5. Quality Assessment
- **Input**: Eligibility decision and workflow data
- **Action**: Evaluates decision quality and compliance
- **Output**: Quality score and recommendation

### 6. User Approval
- **Input**: Decision and quality assessment
- **Action**: Presents decision to user for approval
- **Output**: User agreement or additional instructions

### 7. Benefit Execution
- **Input**: Final approved decision
- **Action**: Executes benefit activation or sends decline notification
- **Output**: Execution confirmation

## üéõÔ∏è Supported Benefits

- **Auto Loan Deferment**: Active duty with PCS/deployment orders
- **Foreclosure Protection (SCRA)**: Active duty mortgage protection
- **Overdraft Fee Refund**: Active duty fee refunds during deployment
- **Credit Card APR Reduction**: SCRA APR reduction to 6%

## üîß Configuration

### Agent Configuration Files

- `agents/request_analysis_agent.py` - Workflow orchestration
- `agents/customer_verification_agent.py` - Identity verification
- `agents/document_processing_agent.py` - Document handling
- `agents/eligibility_decision_agent.py` - Eligibility assessment
- `agents/judge_agent.py` - Quality control
- `agents/user_proxy_agent.py` - User interaction
- `agents/benefit_execution_agent.py` - Benefit execution

### Mock Data

- `mock-data/customers.json` - Customer database
- `mock-data/documents.json` - Document repository
- `mock-data/requests.json` - Benefit requests

## üß™ Testing

### Sample Request IDs

- `REQ-001` - Auto Loan Deferment (Veteran)
- `REQ-002` - Foreclosure Protection (Reserve)
- `REQ-003` - Overdraft Fee Refund (Active Duty)
- `REQ-004` - Foreclosure Protection (Reserve)
- `REQ-005` - Credit Card APR Reduction (Active Duty)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Standard Approval Flow**: Use any REQ-* ID for normal processing
2. **User Disagreement**: Disagree with decision to test correction flow
3. **Document Requests**: Agents will request missing documents automatically
4. **Customer Recheck**: Ask to "recheck customer" to test verification flow

## üîç Advanced Features

### Intelligent User Input Handling

The system supports various types of user input:

- **Agreement**: "Yes", "I agree", "Proceed", etc.
- **Disagreement**: "No", "I disagree", "Change this", etc.
- **Instructions**: "Recheck customer", "Review documents", "Add information"
- **Questions**: "Why was this declined?", "What documents are needed?"
- **Corrections**: "The customer is actually active duty", "Add missing document"

### Structured Output Benefits

- **Reliable JSON**: OpenAI guarantees valid response format
- **Schema Validation**: Strict validation prevents malformed responses
